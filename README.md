### <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hi, I‚Äôm Orestis Kopsacheilis!
I am an Economist specialising on Behavioural and Experimental Economics. 
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Economics and Policy Department of the Technical University of Munich, School of Management. 
I obtained my PhD in 2019 from the University of Nottingham.

### What I'm focusing on üë®‚Äçüíª
I am primarily interested inn questions related to how people make decisions under risk or uncertainty. 
Specifically, I explore how different modes of information-acquisition can influence risky behaviour as well as the willingness to cooperate in social dilemmas. 
I pursue these questions through a mixture of empirical methods involving lab, online and field experiments and use of state of the art statistical modelling with techniques including Bayesian Hierarchical models.
As a behavioural economist, I am committed to academic research that translates to practical impact and policy recommendations.
The topic of medical decision making is of particular interest to me. 
In a recent field-experiment, I explore different channels for motivating people in high-risk group to vaccinate for the seasonal influenza and observe how their subjective-risk perceptions influence this decision.
